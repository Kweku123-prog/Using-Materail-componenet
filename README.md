Flutter provides a number of widgets that help you build apps that follow Material Design. A Material app starts with the MaterialApp widget, which builds a number of useful widgets at the root of your app, including a Navigator, which manages a stack of widgets identified by strings, also known as “routes”. The Navigator lets you transition smoothly between screens of your application. Using the MaterialApp widget is entirely optional but a good practice.
